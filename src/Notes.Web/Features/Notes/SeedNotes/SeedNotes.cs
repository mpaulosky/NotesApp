				// Programming (15 notes)
				("JavaScript Async/Await Patterns",
						"Async/await simplifies asynchronous JavaScript code. The async keyword makes functions return promises. Await pauses execution until promises resolve. Error handling uses try/catch blocks. Common patterns include parallel execution with Promise.all, sequential operations, and error propagation. Avoid mixing callbacks with async/await."),

				("React Hooks Best Practices",
						"React Hooks enable functional components to use state and lifecycle features. useState manages component state. useEffect handles side effects. Custom hooks extract reusable logic. Follow the Rules of Hooks: only call at top level, only call from React functions. useMemo and useCallback optimize performance."),

				("Database Indexing Strategies",
						"Database indexes speed up queries but slow down writes. B-tree indexes work well for range queries. Hash indexes optimize exact matches. Composite indexes support multiple columns. Consider query patterns when designing indexes. Avoid over-indexing. Monitor index usage and remove unused ones. Covering indexes include all queried columns."),

				("RESTful API Design Principles",
						"RESTful APIs use HTTP methods semantically: GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PUT for updates, DELETE for removal. URLs represent resources, not actions. Use nouns, not verbs. Return appropriate status codes. Support pagination for large datasets. Version your API. Implement proper error handling with meaningful messages."),

				("Git Branching Strategies",
						"Git Flow uses master, develop, feature, release, and hotfix branches. GitHub Flow simplifies to main branch and feature branches. Trunk-based development keeps branches short-lived. Feature flags enable deploying incomplete features. Rebase vs merge affects history cleanliness. Squash commits for clean history."),

				("Clean Code Principles",

Generic classes and interfaces enable flexible data structures. Utility types like Partial, Pick, and Omit simplify type manipulation."),

				("Docker Container Optimization",
						"Optimize Docker images by using multi-stage builds to reduce size. Choose minimal base images like Alpine. Combine RUN commands to minimize layers. Order Dockerfile commands from least to most frequently changing. Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files. Leverage build cache effectively."),

				("OAuth 2.0 Authentication Flow",
						"OAuth 2.0 provides secure delegated access. Authorization code flow works for server-side apps. Implicit flow suits single-page applications. Client credentials flow serves machine-to-machine authentication. Refresh tokens extend access without re-authentication. Scopes limit permissions granted. Always use HTTPS."),

				("GraphQL vs REST Comparison",
						"GraphQL allows clients to request exactly needed data, avoiding over-fetching and under-fetching. Single endpoint handles all requests. Strong typing enables better tooling. REST uses multiple endpoints with fixed response structures. GraphQL complexity comes from resolver implementation. REST caching is simpler."),

				("Python List Comprehensions",

Nested comprehensions handle multidimensional data. Dictionary and set comprehensions work similarly. Comprehensions are often faster than explicit loops due to optimization."),

				("SQL Query Optimization",
						"Optimize SQL by selecting only needed columns. Use WHERE to filter early. Joins can be expensive; consider alternatives. Analyze query execution plans. Avoid SELECT * in production. Use appropriate indexes. Batch operations when possible. Denormalization sometimes improves read performance."),

						"Kubernetes orchestrates containerized applications. Pods are the smallest deployable units. Deployments manage pod replicas. Services provide stable networking. ConfigMaps and Secrets manage configuration. Namespaces organize resources. Ingress controllers route external traffic. Use health checks for reliability."),

				("Test-Driven Development Workflow",
